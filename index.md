## The Pandemic That Caused a Decline in Ridership
![MTA NYCT Bus Logos](./Pictures/mtalogo.png)

Objective: The purpose of my project is to analyze MTA bus ridership data each year. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected MTA and its commuters. In this project, I utilized the Pandas Dataframe to filter the data in my CSV file.

Background: It is important to solve this problem because many people who do not own cars rely on public transportation to take them to school and work. Unreliable service is unacceptable as people need to get to their destination on time whether it would be school or work. An existing solution is that bus routes are currently running at pre-pandemic headways. A drawback of the existing solution is that some bus routes do not have enough ridership and are mostly empty.
