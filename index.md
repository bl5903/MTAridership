## The Pandemic That Caused a Decline in Ridership
![MTA NYCT Bus Logos](./Pictures/mtalogo.png)

Objective: The purpose of my project is to analyze MTA bus ridership data during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected MTA and its commuters. In this project, I utilized the Pandas DataFrame to filter the data in my CSV file.

Background: It is important to solve this problem because many people who do not own cars rely on public transportation to take them to school and work. Unreliable service is unacceptable as people need to get to their destination on time whether it would be school or work. An existing solution is that bus routes are currently running at pre-pandemic headways. A drawback of the existing solution is that some bus routes do not have enough ridership and are mostly empty.

Rounding out the top 10 most popular routes from 2020 was the Bx1/Bx2 with 16,429 riders. The Bx1 and Bx2 were counted together because they both travel along the same route between MOTT HAVEN 138 ST VIA CONCOURSE and RIVERDALE 231 ST via CONCOURSE. The only difference is that Bx1 is the Limited version of the Bx2 which means the Bx1 makes fewer stops.

### Analysis/Thoughts
The COVID-19 Pandemic has severely affected the ridership in NYC. Most commuters were either essential workers or commuters that were going out for grocery shopping. During the start of the Pandemic, the MTA decided that all Local/Limited bus rides would be for free. Customers boarded through the back door rather than going through the front door. Customers still had to pay the regular fare to use the subway. As a result, bus routes that ran along subway routes had a better ridership than those that didn't. The B39 was the only bus route in NYC that saw an increase in ridership. The least popular route in NYC was the S55. The least popular routes had an average ridership of 130 riders to 350 riders. The most popular route in NYC was the M15 Local/ Select Bus Service. The most popular routes had an average ridership of 16,500 to 25,500 riders.
