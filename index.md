## The Pandemic That Caused a Decline in Ridership
![MTA NYCT Bus Logos](./Pictures/mtalogo.png)

Objective: The purpose of my project is to analyze MTA bus ridership data during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected MTA and its commuters. In this project, I utilized the Pandas DataFrame to filter the data in my CSV file.

Background: It is important to solve this problem because many people who do not own cars rely on public transportation to take them to school and work. Unreliable service is unacceptable as people need to get to their destination on time whether it would be school or work. An existing solution is that bus routes are currently running at pre-pandemic headways. A drawback of the existing solution is that some bus routes do not have enough ridership and are mostly empty.

The 8th most popular route was the B82 Local/Select Bus Service with 17,012 riders. The 9th most popular route was the Bx19 with 16,463 riders. Rounding out the top 10 most popular routes from 2020 was the Bx1/Bx2 with 16,429 riders. The Bx1 and Bx2 were counted together because they both travel along the same route between MOTT HAVEN 138 ST VIA CONCOURSE and RIVERDALE 231 ST via CONCOURSE. The only difference is that Bx1 is the Limited version of the Bx2 which means the Bx1 makes fewer stops.
