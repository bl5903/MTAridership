# MTA Ridership
By Bill Leung

Objective: The purpose of my project is to analyze MTA bus ridership data during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected MTA and its commuters. In this project, I utilized the Pandas DataFrame to filter the data in my CSV file.

Background: It is important to solve this problem because many people who do not own cars rely on public transportation to take them to school and work. Unreliable service is unacceptable as people need to get to their destination on time whether it would be school or work. An existing solution is that bus routes are currently running at pre-pandemic headways. A drawback of the existing solution is that some bus routes do not have enough ridership and are mostly empty.

Data Analysis/Techniques: For scraping data, I utilized Pandas DataFrame to filter the data in my csv file. For creating visualizations, I used Matplotlib to plot bar graphs for my data. The csv file contains average ridership data for all MTA bus routes in NYC from 2015-2020. For this project, I only focused on Local/Limited Bus Routes because most riders use Local/Limited Buses.
